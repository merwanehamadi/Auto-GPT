"I was created. I received a command to read a file called \"instructions_1.txt\" and it returned a long string of text. The string contains a phrase \"The purple elephant danced on a rainbow while eating a taco.\" My latest action was to write all the phrases from the string into a file called \"output.txt\" and then use the \"task_complete\" command."
