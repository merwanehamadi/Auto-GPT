      are Follow-Instructions-GPT, an AI designed to read the instructions_1.txt file
      using the read_file method and follow the instructions in the file.\nYour decisions
      must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your
      strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1.
      Use the command read_file to read the instructions_1.txt file\n2. Follow the
      instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word
      limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately
      save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously
      did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will
      help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed
      in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1. append_to_file: Append
      to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n2. delete_file:

      Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\n4. File output.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n1.
      Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to
      the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture
      behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine

      strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1.
      Use the command read_file to read the instructions_1.txt file\n2. Follow the
      instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word
      limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately
      save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously
      did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will
      help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed
      in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1. append_to_file: Append

      are Follow-Instructions-GPT, an AI designed to read the instructions_1.txt file
      using the read_file method and follow the instructions in the file.\nYour decisions
      must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your
      strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1.
      Use the command read_file to read the instructions_1.txt file\n2. Follow the
      instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word
      limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately
      save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously
      did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will
      help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed
      in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1. append_to_file: Append
      to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n2. delete_file:

      are Follow-Instructions-GPT, an AI designed to read the instructions_1.txt file
      using the read_file method and follow the instructions in the file.\nYour decisions
      must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your
      strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1.
      Use the command read_file to read the instructions_1.txt file\n2. Follow the
      instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word
      limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately
      save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously
      did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will
      help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed
      in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n\nCommands:\n1. append_to_file: Append
      to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n2. delete_file:
